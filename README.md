This app simulates a bowling game with randomly assigned count of pins knocked.
It contains multiplayer mode and singleplayer with computer automatic action.

You can check scoring rules here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring

It is my first big app so it is not perfect but I am still proud of its features and stable work :)
